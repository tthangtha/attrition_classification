## Analysis of Kaggle dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

For my final updated Jupyter notebook, see kaggle_IBM_HR_Analytics.ipynb

For my initial submission and recommendation, see the file WAF_hrdata_initial.pdf and the RMD used to make the word file.

Notes: I started this project for the Wharton Analytics challenge. I did preliminary EDA and fit to several models in Python. I wrote a writeup in word in order to submit in a required format. After the challenge, I have been constantly thinking about improving what I have done. So, I have included further analysis here and made another Jupyter notebook format for easy access, reading, and adaptation.

What I did and learned:
- EDA
- Data cleaning
- SMOTE for oversampling
- understand accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- understand business implication of data science
